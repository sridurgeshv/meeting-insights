Run the development servers:

```bashCopy# 
Terminal 1 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

```# Terminal 2 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Next Steps to Work On

For Phase 2, you'll need to:

Implement the speech-to-text functionality
Create the meeting type detection system
Develop the summarization pipeline

Would you like me to provide the implementation details for any of these Phase 2 components next?
Key things to note:

The frontend is using shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern look
The backend is set up with Express.js and MongoDB
We've created a basic dashboard layout that will be enhanced with real-time data
The project is structured for scalability and maintainability
